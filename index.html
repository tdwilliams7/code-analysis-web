  Welcome!

  This is a list view for employees that work at WillowTree.


  What it does:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Lists employees photos & names.
  - Search for an employee by name.
  - Sort employees by their first names.
  - Sort empolyees by their last names.
  - Shuffle the list order (because why not).

  Implementation details:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - No compile stepâ€”Just open this file in a browser.
  - The view layer is written in React (without JSX).
    * If you don't know React, don't fret! The logic lives
      outside of it for the most part.


  So... what now?
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Take a look at the code. It works on the surface, but can it be
  improved? Are there things that you would do differently?

  Change it & Have fun!


  Misc. Notes
  ~~~~~~~~~~~

  This code is only expected to work in the latest version of
  Google Chrome. Feel free to use all the latest & greatest
  things that are offered (new API's for JS, CSS, etc.).

  Currently this project does _not_ have a build step (i.e. it runs
  directly by opening the file in Google Chrome). If you finish
  with improvements & feel like there isn't much else to do _then_
  add in a build step if you wish. This is NOT strictly required.
